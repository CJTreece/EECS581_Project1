**Hours spent on project:** 1.5 hours

**Brief summary of what you did:** I implemented place_ships() in player.py and altered battleship.py for testing purposes but I think we should keep some of the changes. I think I encountered a few bugs in board.py's checkShipCollision() function but it may be something else in addShip() that is buggy
