**Brief summary of what you did:** I implemented place_ships() in player.py and altered battleship.py for testing purposes but I think we should keep some of the changes. I think I encountered a few bugs in board.py's checkShipCollision() function but it may be something else in addShip() that is buggy

**Brief summary of what you did:** I messed around with Zach's latest commit and reformatted some things to use the sanitization functions he added. I made it so that when an error due to invalid inputs happens it doesn't clear the screen, although there seems to be a bug where it occasionally still does. I fixed a bug where board.py wasn't actually saving the err codes.
