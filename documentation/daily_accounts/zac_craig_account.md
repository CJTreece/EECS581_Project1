**Time spent on project:** 6 hours

**Brief summary of what you did:** refactored some code from board.py into player.py and vice-versa. I also implemented the player functions to facilitate attacking and placing ships. I have also reconstructed parts of battleship.py to accomodate some of the refactored bits of code. I have added sanitization functions to sanitize inputs given by players to assure that the inputs given by the players are formatted correctly and valid inputs.

**Time spent on project:** 3 hours 30 minutes

**Brief summary of what you did:** changed how we sanitized input and instead use regular expressions to compare user input against a valid format to make sure we can't try to set a string as an int forcefully. I also added some necessary program pauses to make sure the user can read and understand any errors in their inputs. Finally, I added comments to the sections of the code that didn't have any but needed some.
